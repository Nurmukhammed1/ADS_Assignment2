MyArrayList and MyLinkedList are special implementations of ArrayList and LinkedList respectively. 
Both MyArrayList and MyLinkedList use the common MyList interface. Using the foundation laid by MyArrayList and MyLinkedList, we begin to create logical data structures: MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap. 
Each of these constructs is created from either an array-based MyArrayList or a node-based MyLinkedList.
